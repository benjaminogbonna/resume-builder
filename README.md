# Folome

## General Information
Folome is an app that helps to cater for the needs of visually impaired persons or other affected persons
who might need help. Family or friends of the VIP (those getting help) creates an account for them on folome and update their account as VIP
and creates another account on their own devices, update their account as Helper (both have different features). Then from the VIP's device/account, they can add/send invite to as many
helpers as they want (typically those within the family and friends circle) who will track and give assistance to the VIP.


## Installation

Use the package manager [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/) to install all required packages (see requirements.txt)


```bash
pip install <package_name>
```

Activate virtual env and `cd` into folome directory.

Run `python manage.py runserver` to start server (http://127.0.0.1:8000/
), open that in browser.
